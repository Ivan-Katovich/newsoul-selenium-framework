1. Clone framework from git repository.
2. Import OnlinerTest folder into eclipse as maven project 
3. Execute "
 mvn install:install-file 
-Dfile=additional_libraries/sikuli-java.jar 
-DgroupId=org.sikuli 
-DartifactId=sikulijava 
-Dversion=1.0.1 
-Dpackaging=jar 
-DgeneratePom=true
" in console in one row 
4. Execute test with Image checking. 
The test will be failed, but sikuli will write path to libraries to the system path.
5. Restart your computer. Image checking doesn't work without this step.
(May be another way exists, but I don't know it)
